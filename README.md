# ForensikProtection
This tool helps you to protect your computer when you are not allowed to lock the screen.
When enabled, you are not allowed to press any key except the password (and Shift), and mouse clicks are also locked.
In safe mode, you cannot insert a USB stick or move the mouse.

To insert the password, just type it into the empty field. The program will recognize it.
If you enter the wrong password, the computer will be shut down.

Modes:
1. safe mode: If this is activated, the mouse may not be moved and no USB data carriers may be added
2. black mode: Here the screen is black
3. other mode (console only): Another system command can be executed instead

Supported systems: Linux, Windows and Apple Darwin (not tested)

There is no guarantee. Please report any errors.

- Now supports full execution via the console
